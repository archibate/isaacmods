-- Dev Repro -- one key replays a reproduction.
--
-- Press F1 and the driver reloads ITSELF first, so the list that runs is always
-- the one last written to this file -- no retyping, no stale copy. A plain global
-- carries the "run once you come back" intent across that reload, because `luamod`
-- throws away everything else in here.
--
-- STEPS and HINT are the only parts meant to be rewritten. In STEPS a string is a
-- console command and a number is that many frames of waiting; `restart` and
-- `stage` only take effect on a later frame, so each of them needs a wait behind
-- it or whatever follows is swallowed.
--
-- Instruments belong to the task at hand: add whatever the current question needs,
-- and take it out again once that question is answered, so the next run's log and
-- screen carry only what is being asked now.
